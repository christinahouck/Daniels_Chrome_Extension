# Daniel's Chrome Extension
This is a Chrome extension that I built for my husband. It's a hub that houses important links that he uses at work.

The extension can be added to Chrome by visiting <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/daniels-chrome-extension/ajfbjjjhbenfjplpphfnfnikijaebfmg?authuser=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Chrome WebStore</a>. 

Note that many of the links are gated, so you won't be able to use it to its full effectiveness without accounts for the tools that Daniel uses daily. 

It's not really useful if you're not Daniel&mdash;but you can download it to get a feel for what the extension is like.
